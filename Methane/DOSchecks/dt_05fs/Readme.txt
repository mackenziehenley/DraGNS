Checking DOS calculations for a dt = 0.5 fs and varying output frequencies.
All Vout_X folders will have the md files, vacf files, plot pngs, and the indexing file.

The general files contain all input/data files generated in Jupyter notebook using the md-intro-tutorial environment.
The files include the coordiate (.pdb), topology (.top) and md (.mdp) files which are in every BaseFiles directory.
These files are specifically used for the calcualtion of DOS with dt = 0.5fs (dt = 0.0005). 
All files from energy minimization through pressure equilibration are the same.
Only changes between directorys here is the output frequency of the velocities.
